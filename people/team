			<p>After decades of programming, Jack fell in love with Ruby on Rails almost immediately. He started programming in high school on an Apple II computer. His first program was a chess game, but because the computer had no hard drive, he had to re-write the program every time he wanted to play. Since then, Jack has been a technology leader at a wide range of companies from Silicon Valley and Wall Street startups to a major Swiss bank. He holds degrees from Beijing University and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
